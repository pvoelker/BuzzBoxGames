# Buzz Box Games

A collection of simple games that can be played using USB enabled quizbox sets.  It is a way to get new quizzers used to buzzing in on paddles and provides a way for quizzers to relax and take a break during practices.

Supported quizbox sets:
- Brian's Quiz Box (formerly known as Grass Lake Quiz Box)
- Kirkman Basic Quizbox Plus (light gray bottom) -- https://www.quizequipment.com/
