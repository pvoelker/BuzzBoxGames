# Buzz Box Games

## Games

- **Simon Says** - Players repeat the given random pattern of buzzer paddle presses.  After each round the sequence grows.
- **Reaction Time** - Players see who can press their buzzer paddle the fastest.
- **Drop-Tac-Toe** - Red and Green paddles compete against each other to get three of their tokens in a row.
